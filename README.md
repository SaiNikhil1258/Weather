Ever wondered if you should carry an umbrella tomorrow? With this dataset, you can predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

Content
This dataset comprises about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It answers the crucial question: will it rain the next day? (Yes or No).

This column is marked 'Yes' if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
